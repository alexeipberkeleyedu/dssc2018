In this mini-lab we will build a method to predict the travel mode for a trip based on the travel mode of the \"nearest neighbors\". \n",

In this mini-lab we will build a classifier that predicts the travel mode for unobserved trips based on the travel mode of the nearest neighbors. Here, the nearest neighbors are the observation with the most similar delta_travel_time and delta_travel_cost."
